Headings

 * Upgrade the previous/next heading navigation to sync iff the toggle is on.

Scores

 * When representing comment cells, highlight them as instructor feedback and
   specifically highlight lines containing `/[+-](\d+\.\d*|\d*\.\d+)/`.
 * Give Notebooks a method for scoring themselves by summing the scores detected
   in their cells, and place this score in the title bar of each side.
 * Make a hamburger menu item for choosing the initial/default score.

Make a zip downloader.

Representation flexibility

 * Create slightly different visual styles for markdown/code/output.
 * Add syntax highlighting for code cells.
 * Use codemirror for editing markdown cells.

Implement a delete-this-file button (with an Are you sure? prompt, and a
keyboard shortcut).

Keyboard shortcuts

 * Add a hamburger menu item for showing the list of keyboard shortcuts.
 * Add hover text to all buttons and menu items that includes a short phrase
   plus the corresponding keyboard shortcut.
 * Change all the top buttons to have no text, just icons.

Maybe let users also edit any markdown cell?
