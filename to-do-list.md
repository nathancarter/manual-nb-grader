Scores

 * Make an action to save the score for a notebook into the notebook (as an
   initial cell and as part of the filename).

Make a zip downloader.

Representation flexibility

 * Create slightly different visual styles for markdown/code/output.
 * Add syntax highlighting for code cells.
 * Use codemirror for editing markdown cells.

Implement a delete-this-file button (with an Are you sure? prompt, and a
keyboard shortcut).

Maybe let users also edit any markdown cell?
