Scores

 * Display the (always up-to-date) score for a notebook somewhere visible (which
   will require designing a place to put this!).  (Should update in view in
   response to notebook load/insert/delete events.)
 * Make a hamburger menu item for choosing the initial/default score.
 * Make an action to save the score for a notebook into the notebook (as an
   initial cell and as part of the filename).

Make a zip downloader.

Representation flexibility

 * Create slightly different visual styles for markdown/code/output.
 * Add syntax highlighting for code cells.
 * Use codemirror for editing markdown cells.

Implement a delete-this-file button (with an Are you sure? prompt, and a
keyboard shortcut).

Keyboard shortcuts

 * Add a hamburger menu item for showing the list of keyboard shortcuts.
 * Add hover text to all buttons and menu items that includes a short phrase
   plus the corresponding keyboard shortcut.
 * Change all the top buttons to have no text, just icons.

Maybe let users also edit any markdown cell?
