Representation flexibility

 * Use CodeMirror for editing markdown cells.  (But this turns out to not be
   worth the effort--importing CodeMirror is a huge hassle for something so
   small as this need.)

Implement a delete-this-file button (with an Are you sure? prompt, and a
keyboard shortcut).

When a user deletes all files, clear both notebook displays.

Future: Let users edit *any* markdown cell.
